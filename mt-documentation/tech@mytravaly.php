					We are a bunch of proud techies who love to experiment and build products in the travel technology field. We find immense value and satisfaction in this work and hope to continue this journey for as long as possible.
					<br>
					Here’s a list of the products we’ve built:
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="font-weight-bold">Travel Metasearch Engine:</span>
					<br>
					A metasearch engine (or aggregator) is a tool which sends out user queries to various third-party search engines and then compiles the results, thereby making it easier for the user to access all the information in one place. We have designed a metasearch engine which helps the traveller search for accommodations globally.				
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="font-weight-bold">Client Relationship Management (CRM) Software:</span>
					<br>
					CRM software is a tool which helps in managing all the interactions with customers. It acts as a database where all the necessary customer information gets stored along with the queries raised by that particular customer. It is an invaluable resource which businesses can use to learn more about their customers’ choices and preferences and how best to satisfy their needs.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="font-weight-bold">Property Management System (PMS):</span>
					<br>
					PMS is a software application which enables a property owner to manage, coordinate and perform the day-to-day functions and transactions involved in running their business.
					<br>
					It is used to automate many tedious tasks like guest bookings, check-in/check-out, online reservations, room assignment, managing room rates, food and beverage costing, billing, accounts, sales and marketing, inventory management, payroll, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="font-weight-bold">Social Media Account Manager:</span>
					<br>
					PMS is a software application which enables a property owner to manage, coordinate and perform the day-to-day functions and transactions involved in running their business.
					<br>
					This product is designed to help businesses manage all of their social media accounts via a single platform. By automating the process of posting the same content on multiple sites, we help you save valuable time and energy.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="font-weight-bold">User Management System:</span>
					<br>
					The User Management system is designed to help employers in easier management of their employees. We provide various features like create/delete/manage users, get employee attendance reports, list holidays and company related notices, and grant or reject leaves.
