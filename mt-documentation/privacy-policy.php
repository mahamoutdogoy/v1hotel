					Your privacy is critically important to us. It is MyTravaly Worldwide Travel Technology Private Limited’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to mytravaly.com (hereinafter, "us", "we", “our”, “MyTravaly” or "mytravaly.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.
					<br>
					This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and Conditions posted on our website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our website. Depending on your activities when visiting our website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.
				</p>
				<button class="accordion">Your Consent</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						By using the Website, you consent to the collection and use of your information in the manner we describe in this Privacy Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, Please DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE.

					<p>
						Like most website operators, MyTravaly Worldwide Travel Technology Private Limited collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how MyTravaly’s visitors use its website. We also use this information to determine how much traffic the website receives, to statistically analyse website usage, to improve our content, and to customize the website's content, layout, and services.
						<br>
						From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of our website.
						<br>
						MyTravaly Worldwide Travel Technology Private Limited also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on any posts on <a href="http://mytravaly.com">http://mytravaly.com</a>. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to manage the website and to enhance the website based on the usage pattern data we receive. If you are on our mobile website, you will be asked whether you want us to access your geographic location based on the location of your mobile device. If you select yes, and save that setting, we will access and collect your IP address to display custom content to you based on your location. MyTravaly only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
					</p>

				<button class="accordion">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						Certain visitors to MyTravaly Worldwide Travel Technology Private Limited’s websites choose to interact with mytravaly.com in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that MyTravaly gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a newsletter at <a href="http://mytravaly.com">http://mytravaly.com</a> to provide their name and email address.
					</p>
				</div> 

				<button class="accordion">Handling of Electronic Records & Backup</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						In general, we will retain all information collected through the website for, at a minimum, the length of time permitted by law. However, we will delete any personally identifiable information in our database upon your request or as otherwise required by law. We may retain non-personally identifiable information indefinitely. We maintain backup files as a protection against natural disasters, equipment failures, or other disruptions. Backup files protect you and us because they lower the risk of losing valuable data. Backup files may contain records with your personal information. Removing a record from our active files and databases does not remove that record from any backup systems. Such backup data will eventually be passively deleted as backup records are erased through the normal recycling of backup files. In the meantime, as long as backup records exist, they receive the same security protections as our other records.

				<button class="accordion">Security</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						Communications between your browser and portions of the Website containing personally identifiable information are protected with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption.

Once we receive your information we strive to maintain the physical and electronic security of your personal information using commercially reasonable efforts.
						<br>
						NO DATA TRANSMISSION OVER THE INTERNET OR ANY WIRELESS NETWORK CAN BE GUARANTEED TO BE PERFECTLY SECURED. AS A RESULT, WHILE WE STRIVE TO PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION USING COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE AND INDUSTRY STANDARD ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGY, WE CANNOT ENSURE OR GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF ANY INFORMATION YOU TRANSMIT TO US, AND YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.
						<br>
						In the Event of a Security Breach of Your Personal Information If we determine that your personal information has or may reasonably have been disclosed due to a security breach of our systems, we will notify you in accordance with and to the extent required by law using the information that we have on file.
